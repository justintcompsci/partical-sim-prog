A circular slab of uniform thickness (5 units) (cross-section of the slab is illustrated below) is to be used to shield a nuclear reactor. A radioactive particle entering the shield follows a random path by moving forward, backward, left, or right with equal likelihood, in jumps of one unit (You may assume the radioactive particle begins in the shield( position one) ).   A change in the direction of the particle is interpreted as a collision with a Lead atom in the shield. After 10 collisions the particleâ€™s energy has dissipated and will not escape the shield.   If the particle moves forward 6 positions (without exceeding 10 collisions), it has escaped the shielding.  If the particle returns to the reactor, it is has not escaped the shield.  Write a program to simulate 1000 particles entering the shield and determine what percentage of the particles escape the shielding. Note: The simulation for each particle will end when any of the events described above has occurred.
